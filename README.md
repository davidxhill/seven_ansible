### Installation
Install all dependencies and pull down this repository.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/davidxhill/seven_ansible
```
Seven-ansible depends on multiple roles from Ansibleâ€™s official community hub and heavily on roles created by [geerlingguy](https://github.com/geerlingguy) . From the root level of this project, you will need to install the required roles from ansible-galaxy. These roles can be configured by reviewing their documentation by searching [here](https://galaxy.ansible.com/list#/roles?page=1&page_size=10).

```
$ ansible-galaxy install -r provisioning/requirements.yml
```

Once these requirements are completed the box can be created.

```
$ vagrant up
```

> Notes: there have been issues with authentication with vagrant on initial startup. If this happens, ensure the box is running and run `$ vagrant provision` to provision the box. Reload the box after provisioning `$ vagrant reload`
